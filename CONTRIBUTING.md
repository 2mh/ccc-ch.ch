# Contributors Policy

- The current code is always in the `master` branch.
- We never push directly to `master`. This is enforced by Github.
- When changing something, always create a fork or a branch. Do your changes
  there and create a pull request against `master`.
- Pull request must be reviewed and merged by another developer (4 eyes principle).

Thanks for any contributions!
