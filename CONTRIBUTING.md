- When adding a change, always create a fork or a branch. Do your changes there
  and create a pull request against master.
- Pull request have to be created for all changes.
- Pull request have to be reviewed and merged by another developer (4 eyes principle).
- The master branch is protected, nobody can push directly to it without a pull
  request. Force push is disabled.
